## Project Description

The Corrective RAG Agent is an advanced question-answering system that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with additional corrective measures to ensure high-quality, relevant answers.

### Workflow

1. **Question Input**: The process begins with a user-provided question.

2. **Retrieve Documents**: The system retrieves relevant documents based on the input question.

3. **Grade Documents**: Retrieved documents are graded for relevance and quality.

4. **Relevance Check**: The system checks if any retrieved document is relevant to the question.
   - If Yes: Proceeds to generate an answer.
   - If No: Initiates a web search for additional information.

5. **Generate Answer**: Using the relevant documents or web search results, the system generates an answer.

6. **Hallucination Check**: The generated answer is checked for potential hallucinations or inaccuracies.
   - If No hallucinations detected: The answer is provided to the user.
   - If Yes (hallucinations detected): The system asks if the answer addresses the question.
     - If Yes: The final answer is provided.
     - If No: The system initiates a web search for more accurate information.

7. **Web Search**: When needed, the system performs a web search to gather additional, up-to-date information to supplement or correct the answer.

### Key Features

- Document retrieval and relevance grading
- Web search integration for enhanced information gathering
- Hallucination detection and correction mechanism
- Iterative answer improvement process

This Corrective RAG Agent aims to provide accurate, relevant, and hallucination-free answers by combining the strengths of retrieval-based systems with generative AI and web search capabilities.
